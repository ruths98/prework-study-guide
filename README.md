# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

With no prior experience with coding and no knowledge of any coding software or languages, a study guide will prove a neccessary resource for success in the coding bootcamp. In order to retain the wealth of information to be aquired over the ensuing months, a well-organized and information-packed guide is a must-have. This guide will be in the form of a website for access almost anywhere and any time. All notes taken regarding HTML, Javascript, Git, and CSS will reside here for future reference.
